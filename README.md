# ![Yoru Logo](examples/img/favicon.png) 夜 ー ＹＯＲＵ

A lightweight JavaScript framework based on Template and Shadow

## Installation

```sh
npm i --save https://github.com/Schlipak/Yoru
```

or

```sh
yarn add https://github.com/Schlipak/Yoru
```

## Tooling

Yoru ships with a couple (for now) tools to make development easier. First, install Yoru globally:

```sh
yarn global add https://github.com/Schlipak/Yoru
```

This installs a `yoru` command, which can:

* Create a project scaffolding with `yoru new <appname>`
* Run an app with `yoru run | yoru serve` (This currently actually serves the current directory)

## Quickstart

```sh
yoru new myApp && cd my-app && yoru run
```

Navigate to [http://0.0.0.0:3000](http://0.0.0.0:3000)

## Demo
